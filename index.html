                            <p class="basic-text">City of the Dev-Ops will be in the air. This is because it is a play on the buzz word “The Cloud” as clouds are in the air – so the city should be as well. Of course, to maintain structure and scalability, we won’t follow earth’s rotation rather we’ll be in a sort of limbo in the sky watching the planet from below. This is to improve coverage of the active users at the time of their active usage hours. The City of the Dev-Ops is a very urban area as there are large data centers multiple stories tall, and there are office buildings and spaces for people to work everywhere. Other smart cities are subject to natural disasters and other devastating events. With City of the Dev-Ops being in the cloud (figuratively and literally) there is nothing that nature can throw at it to stop it from functioning. </p>

In order to join City of the Dev-Ops, you need to have a desire and passion for development. With this passion the person who’s applying should have a portfolio and resume that will allow them to join the city, if the person doesn’t possess this, then they aren’t passionate enough to join City of the Dev-Ops. </p>

                            <p class="basic-text">The cost of living in City of the Dev-Ops is entirely paid for by your own work. When you join City of the Dev-Ops you’re expected to be a full-time developer, whilst you don’t have to be a Dev-Ops engineer, that is one of the main jobs in City of the Dev-Ops. Automation is a key part of advancement; houses will include features that allow users to automate what they want. The point of this is to make the users life how they want it to be, allowing them to choose what they do and don’t want to do around their home. It’s expected that if you’re living in City of the Dev-Ops, you will be working as a developer to create what is assigned to you by your project managers.</p>

It’s like a closet, you can choose what you want your home to look like in your allocated plot, what’s inside and everything you could want. This allows you to express yourself and find your best working energy inside a space that provokes healthy working environments. Another perk of the City of the Dev-Ops is flexibility, if you’re able to complete your assigned job, you can work from anywhere and complete it any way you like with what City of the Dev-Ops gives you. </p>
